                <p><spam class="mentor-name">Ann Cecile (aka AnniShakti)</spam> first discovered Yoga in America as a child, going to classes alongside her mother. Throughout her own development, she studied with many great teachers from varying traditions and her Yoga practice and teachings are now driven by philosophy, alignment and discipline of asana, pranayama, meditation and Ayurveda.<br/>
                Ann began teaching in 2004 at Anusara Yoga (an offshoot of Iyengar) and later taught Vinyasa and Bikram Yoga and Laughing Yoga. Her longtime passion for Kundalini yoga and Vipassana Meditation also greatly influence her unique approche, and in recent years, she has focused primarily on teaching Yin yoga -- a practice she believes extremely beneficial to our modern lives.<br/>
                Ann also studied classical music throughout her youth; for her, music is one of the most sacred of human expressions through wich she has witnessed the power of spiritual chants and healing sounds paired with yoga practices. She is overjoyed to partner with Kes in this very unique training, where both her passions are shared and aligned.

                <p><spam class="mentor-name">Kes Cardoso</spam> found the path of Yoga as a teen, in Brazil. Later, when  she was living in the UK  during her university years, the path of Hatha and Kundalini Yoga became her tools of self-development and self-unraveling. Yoga and Sacred Sounds redifined her life and in 2015 she began training as a Yoga Teacher and Sound Healing Therapist, embarking in a new career and life journey.<br/>
                Kes is experienced in Kundalini Yoga, Yin Yoga, Sound Healing, Yin-Yang Hatha Flow, Ashtanga, Aerial and Bikram Yoga. She has trained all over the world, building through the years a dynamic repertoire of traditions and practices. Her unique approach and teachings are rich and deeply grounded in ancient philosophy, conscious pranayama, vibrational asanas, kryia practices, chanting and sound meditation, quantum healing energy, and music performance and technique.<br/>
                Today, Kes lives and teaches in the French Côte d'Azur. Her life's call is to evolve through Yoga and Sound for deep long lasting transformation, partnering with Ann to help you find the bridge between you and your upmost potential.

                <p>Our 50 Hour Yin Yoga & Sound Healing Training Immersion  is a gentle, integrative and practical course that creates a sacred space where time expands and slows down, allowing you to find your deepest sense of self. This approach combines a unique blend of yin poses, sacred sounds, meditation through movement and stillness, experiential anatomy, principles of Chinese medicine, breath work, and mind-body ritual practices.

                <h2 class="he-standout">A life fully felt is a life fully lived</h2>
                <p>We know that the way we care for ourselves, others, and the environment is interrelated.  This is why it is so important for us that our training is held in nature — through open windy spaces, in valleys, mountain tops and rivers — so you can immerse in yourself and find your own loving guidance within. In this training you will dive deep in holistic well-being where the richness and subtleties of life are deeply experienced. As you follow your journey through the art of yoga and sound, we will help you cultivate the skills of practicing and guiding: you will learn to transmit from your own grace and power, while you develop your skills and potential as a yogi and as a teacher.
