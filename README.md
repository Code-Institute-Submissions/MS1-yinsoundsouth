# Project: YIN & SOUND IN THE SOUTH

My first milestone project is actually a prototype for a real product: A commercial webpage for our Yin-Yoga and Sound Healing Training Immersion in the South of France. Besides now being a Code Institute student and a future Software Developer Extraordinaire, I have been a full-time Yoga Teacher and Sound Therapist for the past 5 years here in France.

One of my personal dreams has been to create my own retreats and immersive experience-training programs for aspiring yoga teachers and sound healing practitioners. In the beginning of 2019 I encountered the perfect partner (a sister-like yoga teacher and entrepreneur with a bunch of experience and a lot of love in her heart!) and the perfect location (a permaculture retreat center in the French Alps, one-hour drive from Nice!). On this first phase of project development we are doing everything ourselves to keep costs and base-investments low, and I am in charge of web development and digital communications (using my web developing skills and previous marketing experience). 

For this project I will be wire-framing on Figma and using Cloud9, GitHub and GitHub Pages for developing a Bootstrap4 based website (mock-up at this stage).



## My UX Process and Strategy:

### 1. Who —

#### This website is targeted to:
- Qualified and aspiring yoga teachers, wishing to improve their skills and teach Yin Yoga with Sound Healing in their communities;
- Students and practitioners of yoga, fitness or alternative healing modalities wishing to develop a deeper understanding of Yin Yoga and Sound Healing for their own personal or vocational purposes;
- Regular clients who love yoga and are looking for a wellness retreat or short vacation experience in nature.

#### Our demographic is (from larger scope to main avatar):
- French and International clients (mostly from: Europe and USA) ranging from 25-55 years old;
- English-speaking expats living in the South of France (Nice, Antibes, Cannes, Monaco, Menton and surrounding areas, as well as Paris);
- Our current yoga students and clients from Nice and surrounding area (already introduced to our business);
- Our main client-avatar is: females between 30-45 years old who are interested in: yoga, alternative medicines, hiking, outdoor activities, vegetarian and organic food, ecological affairs, and mainstream spirituality.

### 2. What is our client looking to achieve —

This client-avatar is looking for information online on how to get trained or improve their Yin Yoga skills. They are looking for either a formal training or an immersion experience that leads to qualifications for teaching Yin Yoga with Sound Healing support (these two modalities are often used together and lead to combined training). Clients desire to experience an immersion, retreat like program that functions as both intensive training and/or short vacation. Budget is an important element, and they usually can’t afford flagship trainings from Yoga Alliance, for example. 

They need a well explained presentation, in form of an online webpage, that lays out all the important details of how / where / when they can achieve their goals and what they will get as a result if they sign up to our program. They also expect to have easy access to registration and online payment options, as well as easy contact means to inquire about the program if they are unsure or need assistance making a decision.

### 3. How YIN & SOUND IN THE SOUTH will help clients achieve their goals —

The webpage is a user-friendly, one-page scrolling site containing text, images, videos and table layouts to help and guide clients into finding the information they are looking for.

#### User Stories:
A female english-speaking expat in the South of France, who relocated with her husband and needs to redefine her career and social life. She is looking to quickly integrate the job marketing by becoming a yoga instructor among expats moms in her small town community with a short and budget-friendly training.
